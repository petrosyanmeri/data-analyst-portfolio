        <img src="customer_activity_by_hour.png" alt="Customer Activity by Hour">
        <p>Analysis of customer activity by hour at a coffee shop. The chart shows the number of customers visiting the coffee shop during each hour of the day, highlighting peak hours of activity. This analysis helps identify the busiest times of the day, enabling the coffee shop to allocate resources efficiently, such as staffing levels and inventory management. The data reveals intriguing patterns in customer activity throughout the day. Our busiest periods coincide with the morning rush at 7 and 8 o'clock, suggesting that customers are eager to start their day with a cup of coffee. Similarly, the lunch hour sees a surge in activity at 12 and 13 o'clock, indicating that our offerings resonate with those seeking a midday pick-me-up.

        Interestingly, the data highlights a lull in customer traffic around 17 o'clock, signaling a potential opportunity for targeted marketing or promotional activities to boost sales during this quieter period. By understanding these peaks and valleys in customer activity, we can tailor our operations and offerings to better meet the needs of our clientele throughout the day.</p>
        <p>For this analysis, I utilized data from the Coffee Shop dataset available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/viramatv/coffee-shop-data?rvi=1" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.</p>
