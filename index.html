        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Greetings! I'm Meri, a driven and enthusiastic individual currently immersed in the pursuit of my Bachelor's degree in Actuarial and Financial Mathematics. Over the course of my academic journey, my focus has primarily revolved around the intricate realms of actuarial science and financial mathematics, where I've developed a deep-seated understanding of risk management, statistical analysis, and quantitative modeling.

        My fascination with numbers and their real-world applications has been the driving force behind my academic pursuits. Delving into the complexities of financial markets, I've gained valuable insights into the dynamics of investments, asset pricing, and portfolio management. Moreover, my coursework has equipped me with robust analytical skills, enabling me to tackle complex problems with precision and ingenuity.

        However, amidst the rigors of actuarial science and financial mathematics, I've found myself increasingly drawn to the burgeoning field of data science. Recognizing the pivotal role of data in today's digital age, I'm eager to expand my horizons and venture into the realm of data analysis and machine learning.

        Python, with its versatile libraries and intuitive syntax, has emerged as my tool of choice for data analysis and manipulation. While I'm still in the nascent stages of my journey with Python, I'm deeply committed to honing my skills and leveraging the language's capabilities to extract actionable insights from raw data.

        Although my foray into machine learning is yet to commence, I'm fueled by a relentless curiosity and an insatiable appetite for knowledge. I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of machine learning algorithms, exploring their applications in predictive modeling, classification, and beyond.

        In essence, my academic journey thus far has been characterized by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a fervent desire to make meaningful contributions to the fields of actuarial science, financial mathematics, and data science. As I continue to chart my course forward, I remain steadfast in my commitment to lifelong learning, embracing every challenge as an opportunity for growth and innovation.</p>

            <h3>Data Analysis: Customer Activity by Hour</h3>
            <img src="customer_activity_by_hour.png" alt="Customer Activity by Hour" class="chart">
            <p>Analysis of customer activity by hour at a coffee shop. The chart shows the number of customers visiting the coffee shop during each hour of the day, highlighting peak hours of activity. This analysis helps identify the busiest times of the day, enabling the coffee shop to allocate resources efficiently, such as staffing levels and inventory management. The data reveals intriguing patterns in customer activity throughout the day. Our busiest periods coincide with the morning rush at 7 and 8 o'clock, suggesting that customers are eager to start their day with a cup of coffee. Similarly, the lunch hour sees a surge in activity at 12 and 13 o'clock, indicating that our offerings resonate with those seeking a midday pick-me-up.

Interestingly, the data highlights a lull in customer traffic around 17 o'clock, signaling a potential opportunity for targeted marketing or promotional activities to boost sales during this quieter period. By understanding these peaks and valleys in customer activity, we can tailor our operations and offerings to better meet the needs of our clientele throughout the day.</p>
            <p>For this analysis, I utilized data from the Coffee Shop dataset available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/viramatv/coffee-shop-data?rvi=1" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.</p>

            <h3>Data Analysis: Customer Activity by Day of the Week</h3>
            <img src="customer_activity_by_day.png" alt="Customer Activity by Day of the Week" class="chart">
            <p>Analysis of customer activity by day of the week at a coffee shop. The chart illustrates the variation in customer traffic throughout the week, providing insights into busy and slow days. By understanding the weekly patterns of customer activity, the coffee shop can optimize its marketing strategies and promotions to attract more customers during slower periods.
The chart paints a vivid picture of customer engagement over the course of the week. Mondays emerge as our busiest days, with a notable influx of patrons, perhaps seeking to kick-start their week with a caffeine boost. Conversely, Wednesdays appear to be quieter in comparison, presenting an opportunity to implement targeted strategies to enhance midweek traffic and engagement. By leveraging these insights, we can fine-tune our approach to maximize customer satisfaction and drive sustained business growth. </p>
            <p>For this analysis, I utilized data from the Coffee Shop dataset available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/viramatv/coffee-shop-data?rvi=1" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.</p>

    <h3>Data Analysis: Proportion of Customer Activity (In/Out)</h3>
    <img src="customer_activity_pie.png" alt="Proportion of Customer Activity (In/Out)" class="chart">
    <p>Analysis of the proportion of customer activity (in/out) at a coffee shop. The pie chart depicts the distribution of customers who dine in and take out, highlighting customer preferences. Understanding the proportion of dine-in versus take-out orders can inform the coffee shop's layout and service offerings to better accommodate customer preferences. The analysis of customer preferences unveiled by the data presents an intriguing insight into our clientele's habits. It's noteworthy that a significant portion, approximately 52.9%, opt to enjoy their beverages outside the coffee shop, while a substantial 47.1% prefer the ambiance of our establishment. This understanding allows us to fine-tune our service offerings and marketing strategies to cater effectively to both preferences, enhancing overall customer satisfaction and engagement.</p>
