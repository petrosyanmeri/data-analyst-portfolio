        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Meri Petrosyan, currently studying Actuarial and Financial Mathematics as a third-year student at Yerevan State University. My academic journey has been focused on quantitative analysis, risk management, and financial modeling.

        My studies have instilled in me a passion for exploring the complexities of finance and insurance through mathematical lenses. I'm deeply interested in understanding the dynamics of financial markets, identifying risks, and utilizing data-driven insights to inform decision-making processes.

        Beyond the classroom, I actively seek opportunities to apply my analytical skills in practical settings. I'm committed to gaining hands-on experience and expanding my knowledge in quantitative finance and actuarial science through internships, research projects, and extracurricular activities.

        Outside of academia, I enjoy diving into data analysis and exploring the ways in which mathematics, statistics, and technology intersect to drive innovation. I'm fascinated by the power of data to uncover patterns, predict trends, and generate actionable insights across various industries.

        As I continue my academic journey, I'm excited to further develop my expertise in actuarial and financial mathematics. I'm eager to contribute to the field through research, practical applications, and continuous learning, with the aim of making meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of finance and risk management.</p>
