        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Greetings! I'm Meri, a driven and enthusiastic individual currently immersed in the pursuit of my Bachelor's degree in Actuarial and Financial Mathematics. Over the course of my academic journey, my focus has primarily revolved around the intricate realms of actuarial science and financial mathematics, where I've developed a deep-seated understanding of risk management, statistical analysis, and quantitative modeling.

        My fascination with numbers and their real-world applications has been the driving force behind my academic pursuits. Delving into the complexities of financial markets, I've gained valuable insights into the dynamics of investments, asset pricing, and portfolio management. Moreover, my coursework has equipped me with robust analytical skills, enabling me to tackle complex problems with precision and ingenuity.

        However, amidst the rigors of actuarial science and financial mathematics, I've found myself increasingly drawn to the burgeoning field of data science. Recognizing the pivotal role of data in today's digital age, I'm eager to expand my horizons and venture into the realm of data analysis and machine learning.

        Python, with its versatile libraries and intuitive syntax, has emerged as my tool of choice for data analysis and manipulation. While I'm still in the nascent stages of my journey with Python, I'm deeply committed to honing my skills and leveraging the language's capabilities to extract actionable insights from raw data.

        Although my foray into machine learning is yet to commence, I'm fueled by a relentless curiosity and an insatiable appetite for knowledge. I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of machine learning algorithms, exploring their applications in predictive modeling, classification, and beyond.

        In essence, my academic journey thus far has been characterized by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a fervent desire to make meaningful contributions to the fields of actuarial science, financial mathematics, and data science. As I continue to chart my course forward, I remain steadfast in my commitment to lifelong learning, embracing every challenge as an opportunity for growth and innovation.</p>
