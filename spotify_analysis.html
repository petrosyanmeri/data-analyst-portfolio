            <figcaption>This plot displays the top 10 artists by the number of tracks they have in the Spotify dataset.</figcaption>

            <h3>Analysis:</h3>
        <p>The artist with the highest number of tracks is represented at the top of the bar chart, followed by the artist with the second-highest, and so on.</p>
        <p>The x-axis represents the artist names, while the y-axis represents the number of tracks.</p>
        <p>Each bar's height indicates the number of tracks associated with a particular artist.</p>
        <p>The bars are colored green for visibility.</p>
        <p>This visualization helps to quickly identify which artists have the most tracks in the dataset, providing insights into the distribution of songs among different artists.</p>

            <figcaption>This plot illustrates the relationship between the number of artists involved in a song and the proportion of those songs included in Spotify playlists.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Analysis:</h3>
        <p>The x-axis represents the number of artists involved in a song, while the y-axis represents the proportion of those songs included in Spotify playlists.</p>
        <p>Each point on the area plot indicates the average proportion of songs included in Spotify playlists for a specific number of artists.</p>
        <p>The area under the curve showcases the overall trend of how the proportion of songs included in Spotify playlists changes with the number of artists.</p>
        <p>The plot is colored sky blue, making it visually appealing and easy to distinguish from other elements.</p>
        <p>This visualization allows us to understand if there's any correlation between the number of artists contributing to a song and its likelihood of being included in Spotify playlists.</p>
        <p>The upward or downward trend in the proportion indicates whether there's a positive or negative relationship between these two variables.</p>
        <p>The horizontal line drawn at the center might indicate an average proportion across all songs.</p>
