        <p>The visualization offers an intriguing glimpse into the Spotify dataset, showing how tracks are spread among the top 10 artists. On the horizontal line(x-axis) , you'll find the names of these artists, while the vertical line (y-axis) measures the number of tracks they have.

At the top sits Taylor Swift, a heavyweight with a whopping 34 songs, showcasing her dominance in the music scene. As we move down the list, we see other artists, each with their own share of tracks.

Among them is BTS, a group known for their global impact and the last one is Feid. While they have fewer tracks compared to Taylor, their presence is still felt, adding depth to the musical landscape.

Overall, the visualization paints a picture of the diverse soundscape found on Spotify, where each artist brings something unique to the table, enriching our listening experience.</p>

        <h2>Proportion of Songs Included in Spotify Playlists by Number of Artists</h2>

        <p>The plot effectively visualizes the relationship between the number of artists involved in a song and the proportion of those songs included in Spotify playlists. On the x-axis, we see the varying number of artists per song, while the y-axis represents the frequency of these songs appearing in Spotify playlists.

A notable observation is the lack of a clear correlation between the two variables. Despite the initial trend where songs with a single artist tend to be featured more frequently in playlists, with over 5000 instances, this frequency gradually decreases as the number of artists per song increases. For instance, songs credited to six artists or more are included in Spotify playlists less frequently, with fewer than 1000 instances observed.

After reaching a low point with six artists, the frequency of playlist inclusion shows a slight uptick with seven artists, surpassing 1000 instances but remaining below 2000. This uptick followed by a subsequent decrease with eight artists further highlights the complexity of the relationship between the number of artists and playlist inclusion frequency. It suggests that while there may not be a straightforward linear correlation, there are nuanced patterns in playlist curation that warrant further exploration. These fluctuations underscore the diverse factors at play in determining a song's appeal to playlist curators and listeners alike.
